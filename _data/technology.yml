      The biggest problems often require the smallest solutions. NuMat is a
      recognized pioneer in the design of atomically-engineered materials called
      MOFs (Metal-Organic Frameworks). MOFs are a breakthrough material class with
      vast surface areas, highly tunable porosities, and near-infinite
      combinatorial possibilities. Critically, they can be programmed to uniquely
      interact with target molecules in ways that incumbent material technologies
      cannot, providing a differentiated platform for downstream product and
      process innovation.

      We design atomically engineered materials through the application of modern
      computing infrastructure to proprietary material discovery algorithms. Using
      our world-class discovery platform, we create millions of hypothetical
      structures, store these structures in databases, and then use
      high-performance computing to rapidly simulate their properties. We
      then experimentally validate the performance of materials through an
      automated workflow, providing a powerful prediction-meets-data feedback
      loop. This capital-light approach allows us to dramatically reduce
      development cycles, rapidly generate IP, and support valuable application
      platforms with tailor-designed solutions.

      NuMat’s state-of-the-art pilot and commercial-scale operations support the rapid
      scale-up of target materials from milligram to ton scales. Beyond scale-up, our
      dedicated team of process engineers bring years of expertise in yield
      optimization, post-synthesis processing, and material formation. These
      capabilities are critical in informing our development activities, supporting
      rapid prototyping, and ensuring we prioritize scalable, cost-enabled materials.

      Beyond material discovery, NuMat’s core expertise is in the rapid design,
      integration, and build of hardware systems enabled by novel material
      technologies. To do this, we focus first on the performance requirements of
      fully integrated systems. We then work backwards to identify the enabling
      properties of candidate materials which will translate to our target
      performance requirements. Our experience shows this is the key capability gap
      in material commercialization. NuMat’s team brings years of experience in
      successfully developing the material-enabled product platforms the world wants
      and needs.

      NuMat builds the hardware products we’ve designed in our ISO:9001 certified
      assembly facility. Our best-in-class quality management system integrates
      state-of-the-art analytical capabilities with batch-level data and global
      asset tracking software, providing full traceability and visibility on every
      step of the production process and supply chain.

      > We are committed to achieving business excellence through the development
      of innovative products and processes that critically depend on material
      performance. To do so, we will execute flawlessly against customer
      requirements, exceed best in class quality standards and maintain regulatory
      and safety compliance, all while continuously improving our operations and
      quality management systems. <br /><br />
