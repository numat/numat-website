  description: On America’s roads, we’re seeing a lot more big vehicles, like buses
      and trucks, that run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). So why don’t we see any
      passenger cars run on the same fuel? Because natural gas needs to be extremely
      compressed in order for us to use it, we need HUGE gas tanks, and they are too
      big to fit into most cars. In other words, the tank needs to be shrunk. One
      company is working on doing just that. Instead of compressing gas, they
      discovered that more gas can be stored if there are more surfaces for the
      methane molecules to attach to. The researchers are working on developing a
      cyrstal-like material, called NuMat, that can be placed inside small tanks.
      They say that just a gram of the material has the same surface area as a
      football field! The company is still young, but they feel they are well on
      their way in their mission to move the Planet Forward. In fact, the U.S.
      Department of Energy agrees -- they awarded NuMat a $1.5 million grant!

      their nanomaterials would be for natural gas tanks used in everyday motor
      vehicles. This material can overcome the major hurdles impeding natural gas
      automobiles currently by: storing natural gas at a lower pressure making
      natural gas fuel tanks safer; enabling design flexibility such that the tanks
      can be designed around current automobile underpinnings, reducing production
      costs and shortening development time; and increasing driving range. Their
      technology would also enable the possibility of refueling natural gas vehicles
      at home."

  description: When most graduate students speak about their doctoral research
      at scientific gatherings, the response is usually polite applause and some
      probing questions from faculty. But when Christopher E. Wilmer spoke about his
      graduate work as part of a presentation at the Rice Business Plan Competition
      in Houston this April, he and his colleagues from NuMat Technologies walked
      away with more than $850,000.

  description: Are young entrepreneurs out to change the world? That was the
      impression I got last month when I served as a judge at the Global Venture
      Labs Investment Competition at the University of Texas at Austin. This was my
      first time at the Venture Labs competition, where 37 teams from 13 countries
      (the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia,
      France, Germany, Mexico, Norway, Singapore and Thailand) competed for a prize
      package worth $135,000. This was the 29th annual competition. Grand prize
      winner NuMat Technologies, which hails from Northwestern University in
      Illinois, is a clean energy company that designs and creates high-performance
      materials to store clean fuels and produce them on a large scale for industry.

  description: The 2012 Rice Business Plan Competition (RBPC) crowned NuMat
      Technologies from Northwestern University as the world champion startup
      company Saturday night for its invention of a nanomaterial that can store
      gases just like a sponge soaks up water. The Northwestern team took home
      $874,300 of the more than $1.55 million in cash and prizes presented at the
      awards banquet.

  description: Not only are our materials high performing and tailorable, but
      they are also *predictable*. Knowing nothing more than the starting reagents,
      it’s possible to construct the material, discern its characteristics, and test
      it in a storage or separation application using nothing more than a computer.
      This rapid material prototyping allows us to find the right material for every
      application.
