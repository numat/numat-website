    NuMat’s expertise lies in the design and integration of
    atomically engineered materials into next-generation storage, separation,
    and purification systems. In doing so, NuMat enables previously unachievable
    form factors, performance, and cost-advantaged production economics in the
    electronics, healthcare, industrial, and energy sectors.

    A universal property of gases is that they highly concentrate on surfaces. NuMat
    takes advantage of this property by creating materials with vast internal surface
    areas. One of our materials has the highest reported surface area to date; one
    gram of this material, when unfolded, would cover *over 1.5 football fields*. This
    surface area enables our materials to soak up gases like a bath sponge soaks up
    water, displacing the need for high compression. Reducing compression
    requirements unlocks significant form factor innovation and improved safety,
    fundamentally changing how gases are stored, transported, and delivered.

    Increasingly demanding purity requirements in the electronics, healthcare,
    and industrial sectors are pushing the limits of current separation
    technologies. In fact, tremendous amounts of energy are consumed to upgrade gases and
    liquids, impacting our ability to efficiently create life-sustaining
    resources and effectively capture life-threatening ones.

    By programming materials to have ultra-selective interactions with target
    molecules, we can fundamentally alter the scale versus purity trade-offs of
    incumbent separation technologies, enabling miniaturized, energy-efficient
    separation – creating novel supply-chains in the process.
