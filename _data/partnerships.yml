      ## True technology innovation is hard.

      At NuMat, our partnering thesis involves a set of core questions.

       - Can we design and develop a better product through partnering?
       - Can we introduce a new product faster together?
       - Can we reduce costs and risks through partnering?
       - If successful, are we creating sufficient value to justify our joint
         investment?

  - title: Risk Sharing + Open Innovation
    subtitle: Our Partnership Approach

    description: |
      Our experience has shown that the most successful development partnerships
      involve the following elements.

       - An open innovation approach with an emphasis on application discovery
       - Committed technical and commercial engagement across both organizations
       - Stage-gate methodology with defined milestones and clear objectives
       - An emphasis on early proofs of concept and rapid, low-cost prototyping
         toward Go/No-Go decisions
       - Risk sharing with each party contributing expertise and resources to
         help the other be successful

      We pride ourselves on being trusted collaborators who care deeply about our
      partner’s success. This is our ethos and how we do business.
